changes:
  - balance: "Sol is GONE, but you still get free levels every 10 mins - the cap on free levels has been increased from 3 to 6."
  - balance: "All clans (except tremere, unchanged) now get every vampire ability at level 1 roundstart, but only level up 1 ability at a time."
  - balance: "Vampires no longer have hardcrit immunity."
  - balance: "Vampires no longer have extra flash vulnerability (like mothpeople)."
  - qol: "Vampires no longer go mute and deaf when in frenzy."
  - balance: "The bonus to max blood volume and regeneration per level has been nerfed."
  - bugfix: "Bloodsucker abilities are now fixed to actually take blood to activate again (this was broken for idk how long)"
  - balance: "The bloodsucker maximum blood volume is now the actual bloodsucker maximum blood volume, instead of letting you have up to double the listed max blood. Extra blood drank still counts towards blood thickening."
  - balance: "The amount of blood required to level up from drinking from sentient mobs (blood thickening) starts higher by default but increases a bit less per level. It also no longer increases when you receive free levels, but rather only when you actually use blood thickening to level up. You also no longer get ANY blood thickening from drinking from vassals (previously was 1/4 the regular amount)."
  - balance: "Ventrue has had its initial max level increased from 3 to 4 (you now advance to level 4 before having to spend levels on your favorite vassal). In addition, ventrue's favorite vassal follows the same power scaling as their master (you don't level up every power every rank, you just get 1 power per rank). However, after the ventrue vassal has fully turned into a vampire, both them and their master can rank up normally by drinking blood again."
  - balance: "Ventrue can no longer spend a flat amount of blood to level up their vassal, and instead just follows the normal blood thickening scaling."
  - balance: "Ventrue vampires can now drink from mindless mobs in a pinch, but take a severe mood penalty."
  - qol: "You can level up multiple times inside a coffin without having to open and re-shut it."
  - balance: "Buffs/changes vanishing act: Vanishing act is now an ability every vampire gets when they make a lair, and you can use it instantly at any time, but it has a 5 min cooldown. Similar to heretic blade breaks, but way more counterable. You also still drop all your shit if someone sees you in a lit area. Being full stunned, silver cuffed, or bluespace grounded will all still prevent vanishing act."
  - balance: "Buffs trespass: Higher levels now increase the range of trespass, +1 per level."
  - balance: "Buffs predatory lunge - the \"spinning\" telegraphing effect has been reduced to 1s, and is gone at level 3 instead of 4. The ability now has a range that starts at 4 tiles and increases every level."
  - bugfix: "Fixes predatory lunge not working before level 4 unless you were adjacent to the target."
  - balance: "Changes cloak of darkness: only makes you unable to sprint rather than forcing walking. You also can now start your cloak even if others can see you. However, similar to the current behavior of tremere's obfuscate, if you attack or get attacked while in cloak, your cloak will break."
  - balance: "Changes fortitude: Removes fortitude forcing to walk, however: you are still unable to sprint, and the ability is a limited duration, starting at 10s with a 30s cooldown. Higher levels increase the duration and reduce the cooldown. Level 4 is still full stun immunity, for the duration of the ability. Also, activating/ending fortitude gives chat messages and an icon above your head to everyone around you, as the old tell (force walking) is now gone."
  - balance: "Buffs mesmerize: mesmerize now silences the target on lvl 1 instead of 2."
  - balance: "Nerfs brawn slightly: brawn now requires level 2 to break restraints and no longer lets you break doors at level 4."
  - bugfix: "Brawn now respects pacifism when attacking someone."
  - qol: "Feed now requires you to be pulling someone, and automatically ends when you stop pulling someone."
  - balance: "Feed is now a lot more obvious to other players around when you start it, displaying an icon above your head and playing a sound. (don't feed in the public halls you sickos!)"
  - balance: "The time it takes to feed by default is much faster, and still gets a bit faster every level (although now linearly instead of exponentially), but also now can't go below 2 seconds."
  - balance: "\"Immortal Haste\" has been renamed to \"Sweeping Dash\" and nerfed to have a range- the range starts at 2 tiles and increases 1 per level. The knockdown still increases with every level as well."
  - balance: "Revenge and favorite vassals can now both be deconverted by mindshield."
  - balance: "Vampires get \"Escape on the escape shuttle alive and not in custody\" objective instead of just survive, and also their random vassalization objective is no longer optional."
  - balance: "Vampires can no longer cure deep-rooted/permanent traumas by sleeping in a coffin/entering torpor, making them both paxxable and lobotomizable."
  - balance: "Tremere's Thaumaturgy blood shield has had its block chance reduced from 75% to 50%."
  - balance: "Tremere's Thaumaturgy now has higher level requirements to unlock each of its abilities, and also can no longer break airlocks at any level."
  - balance: "Tremere's Obfuscation now makes you fully revealed when you are hit instead of 100 alpha still."
  - qol: "Tremere's temporary vassals made by dominate now have hard of hearing and soft spoken instead of being fully mute and deaf (they can still hear and speak totally normally with lvl 4 dominate)"
  - spellcheck: "Fixed a number of typos in vampire ability descriptions and code comments, as well as updating many ability descriptions."
  - qol: "You now enter torpor if you have any missing limbs in a coffin, even if you are otherwise healthy."
