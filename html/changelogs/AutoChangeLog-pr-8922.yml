  - balance: "(necromanceranne) Flux anomalies detonate in a much smaller explosion, but release a wide EMP as well."
  - balance: "(necromanceranne) Long range gas analyzers can now scan anomalies."
  - spellcheck: "(lelandkemble) whispering now spelled correctly"
  - balance: "(Ghommie) airlocks affected by dimensional anomalies retain their access, as well as access-adjacent attributes such as emergency access and unrestricted sides."
  - bugfix: "(Ghommie) Bluespace anomalies should no longer teleport 'un-teleportable' mobs like anchored AIs or megafauna."
  - bugfix: "(Jacquerel) Neutralising an anomaly cannot produce more anomaly cores than are supposed to exist in a single round"
  - code_imp: "(SyncIt21) removes a redundant var from anomaly effects"
