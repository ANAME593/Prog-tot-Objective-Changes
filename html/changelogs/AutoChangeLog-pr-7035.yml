changes:
  - bugfix: "Voice Activator circuit components now properly decode messages, meaning apostrophes and such no longer make the message look weird."
  - balance: "Voice Activator circuit components can now only understand roundstart languages - languages such as codespeak, xenomorph, blah-tongue, shadowtongue, etc will not be translated."
