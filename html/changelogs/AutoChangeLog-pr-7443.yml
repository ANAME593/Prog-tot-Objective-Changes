changes:
  - refactor: "(timothymtorres) Sound has been heavily optimized and will now ignore low volume sounds from far away."
  - admin: "(timothymtorres) Add debugging sound earmuffs to admin equipment inside the debug box. Wear them to determine a sounds max range, distance, volume, and sound name. Highly recommended to walk otherwise you will get spammed with footstep sounds."
  - bugfix: "(grungussuss, Melbert) After 4 years, computer sound loop now works properly."
