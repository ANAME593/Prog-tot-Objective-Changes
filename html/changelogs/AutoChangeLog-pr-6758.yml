changes:
  - refactor: "Food hunger bar has been refactored, and moved. Now it sits next to the moodlet face, and dynamically updates as you eat."
  - refactor: "Food moodlets now update a lot more snappily. There is now a moodlet tier between \"being fat\" and \"being normal\", to reduce accidentally gorging yourself to \"fatness\" tier."
  - qol: "Adds a hunger tier between hungry and starving (for mood)"
  - rscdel: "You can't hallucinate being hungry... for now."
  - bugfix: "All humans no longer have a baseline \"75\" ghost nutrition (which means you can eat more)"
  - rscdel: "Having any wounds no longer gives you an alert in the top right."
  - qol: "Having any wounds now make the corresponding bodypart on your health doll (the lil dude on the right side of the screen) glow red."
  - refactor: "Refactored how the hud's health doll shows up for humans. Report any oddities."
